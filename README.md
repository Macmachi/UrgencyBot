## Demo
🔗 **[Try out the bot here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TILK/UrgencyBot)** (Ensure you have an OpenAI API key) 🔗

## ⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️  
This project explores GPT-4's medical capabilities. **Please do not use it for real-life medical scenarios!** 🚫🩺

## 📝 **Instructions** 📝
1. Insert your OpenAI API key in `app.py`: 
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```
2. If running the code locally, you can uncomment the tiktoken library and its related functions. Find them by searching for "tiktoken". This isn't compatible with Gradio but gives an estimation of the token count used for the API prompts.
