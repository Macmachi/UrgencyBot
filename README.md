# UrgencyBot
Medical chatbot using gradio and GPT4 api to provide medical advice

You can try the bot here (if you have an open ai api key) : https://huggingface.co/spaces/TILK/UrgencyBot 

# WARNING 
This project is a test of GPT4's medical features and should not be used for real use cases!

# Instructions
1. Put your key for the openAI api here in the app.py : OPENAI_API_KEY = ""
2. You can uncomment the tiktoken library and associated functions (by searching for the term tiktoken) if you run the code locally as it does not work in gradio. This allows to have an estimation of the number of tokens used for the prompt sent to the api. 

# Credits
Thanks for quoting me if you take back the code ;)
